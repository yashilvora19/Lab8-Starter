**How are graceful degradation and service workers related?**

**Answer:** Graceful degradation is when we start with max technology and hopefully address lower levels with grace. With progressive enhancement, we write HTML first, then enhance it with CSS, then enhance it with JS. This is the same thing, but the other way around. By using service workers, we are making sure that our application can work offline as well and the user gets a better experience since they can use it under various circumstances. Network issues like slow or no network won't spoil their user experience. By enabling offline capabilities, caching resources and intercepting network requests, service workers are directly linked to graceful degradation allowing them to have an uninterrupted experience. Basically, by implementing or using service workers, developers can implement graceful degradation. This "gracefully" handles failures and makes the application more robust.
